about.nassim: 'Nassim Ezzakraoui in the daily life is an actuary. Most likely you don’t know about that job and we don’t mind. Actually more than analyzing risk, what Nassim like above all is to put his football boot on and dribbling on field. He played for Besaonçon academy and realized he is not improving as much as he wants to in a football club ( there you go Nassim we don’t always have what we wants). On the other hand he realize that he learn much more playing alone or with his friends in the street. In 2013, while he is trying to get a football scholarship to play in the US he realize the lack of visibility a lot of young amateur players are facing. Bestfootball was born.'
